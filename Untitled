Where do people go to appreciate illustration in a storytelling capacity?
Where online? Where offline?
How do writers and illustrators collaborate? What's their process?
How and where would you get an understanding of this process?
Is there such a thing as a permanent workshop?
Is there a place for story writers to go and write with materials, inspiration, and tools that allow collaboration?
Should this be limited to writers and illustrators?

My theory is:
Individually, creative writing and illustration are interesting and engaging mediums. They marry up well together, and are a major part of how the public identify with stories, characters and can shape and instruct imaginations. But how often do we see this deconstructed. Perhaps at a gallery?

I've already mentioned my inability to engage with gallery exhibitions. Does this far-reaching, beloved artistic and creative relationship need a permanent instalment for the public to appreciate?

A permanent tour through the creative minds of some of the worlds best AND least known writers and illustrators. Would there be a way to contribute or engage in some way that goes beyond the uni-directional library experience of discovery?

How would resources be managed?
How do people get involved?
Why is this an important thing for people to experience?
The future of art education
